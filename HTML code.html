<br>

According to Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, Musk almost sold Tesla to Google for $11 billion in 2013. Tesla’s future looked bleak at the time, so Musk approached Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and CEO, for a takeover. Musk proposed that Google purchase Tesla for $6 billion, with Musk promising to invest another $5 billion in factory expansion. Musk also demanded that Page hand over control of Tesla to him for the next eight years. The deal came to a halt at the eleventh hour when the sales of Model S, an all-electric five-door liftback produced by Tesla, Inc began to pick up. Tesla is expected to be worth around $100 billion by 2020.<br>

<br>

Musk’s first business venture was the founding of Zip2, a company that provided newspapers with maps and business directories and was later sold to Compaq for $307 million.

<h2>So this rounds up the lesson - 1. Hope you enjoyed it!! &#128512;
<hr style=color:red>

<h1 id = "lesson2">Lesson - 2 <br> ADDING LINKS</h1>

<h2>1.Anchor element (hypertext link)</h2>
<p>code: <code> &lt;a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en"&gt; lamborghini &lt;/a&gt; </code></p>

<p>Example:<a href="https://www.lamborghini.com/en-en" style=color:blue;> lamborghini </a> (To make a selection of text a link, simply wrap it in opening and closing
<a>...</a> tags and use the href attribute to provide the URL of the target
page.) </p>

<hr>

<h2>2.THE HREF ATTRIBUTE</h2>

<p>You’ll need to tell the browser which document to link to, right? The href
(hypertext reference) attribute provides the address of the page or resource
(its URL) to the browser. The URL must always appear in quotation marks.
<br>
<br>
There are two ways to specify the URL:<br><br>
Absolute URLs:<br>
Absolute URLs provide the full URL for the document, including the
protocol (http:// or https://), the domain name, and the pathname as
necessary. You need to use an absolute URL when pointing to a document
out on the web (i.e., not on your own server)<br><br>

Relative URLs:<br>
Relative URLs describe the pathname to a file relative to the current
document. Relative URLs can be used when you are linking to another
document on your own site (i.e., on the same server). It doesn’t require the
protocol or domain name—just the pathname
<br>
<img src="images/link_structure.JPG" height="300" width="600">
</p>

<hr>

<h2>3.Linking Within a Directory</h2>
<p>code: <code> &lt;a href ="Index.html"&gt; home &lt;/a&gt; </code></p>

<p>Example:<a href ="Index.html" style=color:blue;>home</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>4.Linking to a Lower Directory</h2>
<p>code: <code> &lt;a href ="Images/link_structure.JPG"&gt; structure &lt;/a&gt; </code></p>

<p>Example:<a href ="Images/link_structure.JPG" style=color:blue;>structure</a>(and it goes on and on)</p>

<hr>

<h2>5.Linking to a Higher Directory</h2>

<p>Example:(In Unix, there is a pathname convention just for this purpose, the “dot-dotslash” (../). When you begin a pathname with ../, it’s the same as telling the browser “back up one directory level” and then follow the path to the specified file.)<br>(Can you guess how you’d back your way out of two directory levels? Simple: just use the dot-dot-slash twice)</p>

<hr>

<h2>6.MAIL LINKS</h2>
<p>code: <code> &lt;a href ="mailto:Random@example.com"&gt; random guy &lt;/a&gt; </code></p>

<p>Example:<a href="mailto:random@example.com" style=color:blue;>random guy</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>7.TELEPHONE LINKS</h2>
<p>code: <code> &lt;a href="+91-466-773-1188"&gt; Call &lt;/a&gt; </code></p>

<p>Example:<a href="+91-466-773-1188" style=color:blue;>Call</a></p>

<h2>So this rounds up the lesson - 2. Hope you enjoyed it!! &#128512;
<hr style=color:red>

<h1 id="lesson3">Lesson-3 <br> ADDING IMAGES</h1>

<h2>1.THE IMG ELEMENT</h2>
<p>code: <code> &lt;img src="images/girl.jpg alt="girl" height="200" width="400"&gt; </code></p>

<p>Example:<img src="images/girl.jpg" alt="girl" width="200" height="400"></p>

<hr>

<h2>2.Providing the Location with src</h2>
<p>code: <code>src="URL"</p>

<p>Example:The value of the src attribute is the URL of the image file. In most cases, the images you use on your pages will reside on your own server, so you will use relative URLs to point to them.</p>

<hr>

<h2>3.Providing Alternative Text with alt</h2>
<p>code: <code> alt="text"</p>

<p>Example:Every img element must also contain an alt attribute that provides a text alternative to the image for those who are not able to see it. Alternative text (also called alt text) should serve as a substitute for the image content—conveying the same information and function. Alternative text is used by screen readers, search engines, and graphical browsers when the image doesn’t load</p>

<hr>

<h2>4.Providing the Dimensions with width and height</h2>
<p>code: <code>width="number" & height="number" </p>

<p>Example:The width and height attributes indicate the dimensions of the image in number of pixels. Browsers use the specified dimensions to hold the right amount of space in the layout while the images are loading rather than
reconstructing the page each time a new image arrives, resulting in faster
page display. If only one dimension is set, the image will scale proportionally.</p>

<hr>

<h2>5.ADDING SVG IMAGES</h2>
<p>code: <code>&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 300 180"&gt; <br>
&lt;rect width="120" height="40" fill="purple" rx="20" ry="20"/&gt; <br>
&lt;text x="30" y="30" fill="yellow" font-family="'Verdana-Bold'"
font-size="36"&gt; <br>
hello!<br>
&lt;/text&gt; <br>
&lt;/svg&gt; 
</p>

<p>Example:<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 120 40">
<rect width="120" height="40" fill="purple" rx="20" ry="20"/>
<text x="30" y="30" fill="yellow" font-family="'Verdana-Bold'"
font-size="36">

</text>
</svg></p>

<h2>6.Embedded with the img Element</h2>

<p>Example:<img src="Images/bill_gates.svg" width="200" height="304"></p>

<mark>Scope:(Accessibility experts recommend that every th element contain a scope attribute to make its associated data explicitly clear)<br>Headers:(For really complicated tables in which scope is not sufficient to associate a table data cell with its respective header such as when the table contains multiple spanned cells, the headers attribute is used in the td element to explicitly tie it to a header’s id value.Unfortunately, support of the id/headers feature is unreliable. The recommended best practice is to create tables in a way that a simple scope attribute will do the job.)<br>thead,tbody:(You can describe rows or groups of rows as belonging to a header, footer, or the body of a table by using the thead, tfoot, and tbody elements, respectively.Some user agents (another word for a browser) may repeat the header and footer rows on tables that span multiple pages. For example, the head and foot rows may print on every page of a multipage table. Authors may also use these elements to apply styles to various regions of a table.)<br>Colgroup:(Column groups are identified at the start of the table, just after the caption if there is one, and they give the browser a little heads-up as to the column arrangement in the table. The number of columns a colgroup represents is specified with the span attribute.)<br>col:(That’s all there is to it. If you need to access individual columns within a colgroup
for scripting or styling, identify them with col elements.)</mark>
